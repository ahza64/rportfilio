          To me, making the world a better place is helping people overcome
          unfounded fears, and fulfilling our basic human needs. I think,
          fundamentally, we are not good or bad. I think we are all doing our
          best, from what we know, to calm our fears, and fulfill our basic
          needs. I feel happy to have had so many opportunities in my life to
          help make the world a better place and I welcome more opportunities
          to help others.

      <h2 class="link"><a href="https://project-03.herokuapp.com/">SF secrets</a></h2>
      <p>Find out the secrets in San Francisco by either clicking on the map icon, or the tag on the list. Log in, and create your own secrets. Built this from the ground up in 8 days. I utilized Angular abundantly in this app, and made all of my external API calls on the client side to minimize IP pings.</p>

      <h2 class="link"><a href="https://banana-taco.herokuapp.com/">Vagabond</a></h2>
      <p>Find out what others think of three different cities by logging in and adding a post, or commenting on others posts. Built in Ruby and RoR, this group project was built in 4 days. I was responsible for project management, setting up a few controllers, database associations and debugging.</p>

      <p>Figure out the shortest route to take among the destinations you need to travel. Our first team project. I was responsible for project management, building the controllers and most of the Sql database, setting up Auth, rendering the map, and making the external API call.</p>

      <h2 class="link"><a href="https://wntprojects.herokuapp.com/">proBuilder</a></h2>
      <p>Track your projects, the members on those projects, and their assigned tasks. This is my first full stack project. Using MEN technology, I built this app from the ground up in 5 days. I wanted to build an app without using client side data and embedded data in MongoDB. I used pure jQuery DOM manipulation from the database to alter the UI.</p>
